# Introduction-to-Programming-II

There was a series of 10 projects over the semester that I worked on. Each of these projects are included in this repository.
It was introduction to coding involving the basic Object Oriented Programming

Part I: Emploring the OO programming paradigm by organizing code into instantiable classes, and relating those classes to other classes using inheritance, interfaces, and generics.  Through this exploration, I deepened my understanding of the benefits associated with encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.  I also made use of object diagrams and payed close attention to the underlying representations of these objects in memory.

Part II: I compared different algorithms and data structure implementations of several abstract data types.  Analyzing the time complexities of these implementations led me to some useful optimizations, and provided a foundation for developing more complex algorithms and data structures.  My code primarily focuses on implementations of list, stack, queue, and priority queue interfaces, as well as some fundamental sorting algorithms.
